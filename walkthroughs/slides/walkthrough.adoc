== Thank You!

Thank you all for the work on Solution Explorer:


* Short cut to the user
* Reduce friction

=== Imagine

[%step]
* They express how we want a cluster to work (collect user stories tues/wed)
* SOPs are walkthroughs on a QE cluster (get an example SOP)
* They're easy

=== Existing writers

* You ?


== Find a Solution Pattern

Instead of writing, you can find existing files that suit your purpose.

=== Find a user story on customer portal

. Find an AsciiDoc file:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.4/[AMQ] online -> link:https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/tree/master/documentation[Upstream docs]
* 3scale -> internal only
* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/3/[OSD] -> link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/tree/dedicated[Upstream docs]

. Copy the source file. 

=== Create a repo from the template

. Navigate to https://github.com/pwright/curly-garbanzo
. Click *Use Template*.

=== Add your file to the repo

. Edit the `/walkthroughs/empty/walkthrough.adoc` file to add your content from step one.

. Commit and push your changes.
